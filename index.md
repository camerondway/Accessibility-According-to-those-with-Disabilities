### Lack of captions

### Wall of text

### Small font size

### Zooming Problems

### Low contrasts and image of text

### Bright color schemes

### Relying only on color

### Mouse-focused sites

### Too small touch-targets

### Captchas

### Take aways
- Web accessibility is about so much more than just blind people with screen readers.
- Basically everything that people with disabilities comment on are things that annoy everyone, so fixing these issues makes your interface better for all users!
- A lot of what people comment on is not covered by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. So you need to test with users with disabilities!
