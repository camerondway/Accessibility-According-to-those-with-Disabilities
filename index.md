## Accessibility According to those with Disabilities

[This](https://axesslab.com/accessibility-according-to-pwd/) all started with a tweet asking those on the internet who have disabilities what can be a struggle on the web.

### Lack of captions

![Lack of Captions](/assets/images/captions.png)

* Videos without captions(subtitles) was said the most.
  * Videos without captions can exclude users who are deaf or hard of hearing and could also affect users who forgot headphones on the train, or a place where sound can’t be played aloud. Sometimes even autistic people rely on captions if their senses become overloaded. It can be confusing if a person is talking off screen for them.
  * **Do not rely on Youtube's auto subtitling, it isn’t completely accurate yet.**

### Motion, animations, cluttered pages

![Motion, animations, cluttered pages](/assets/images/animations.png)

* Can annoy users without disabilities, but can be really frustrating for those with cognitive impairments.
* Can be very distracting to users with ADHD.
* Mouse Over effects/animations, sudden autoplay, etc. can frustrate the user.

### Wall of text

![Wall of text](/assets/images/walloftext.png)

* Large chunks of text can be a challenge for those with dyslexia or cognitive impairments.
* Neverending sentences and complicated language can be a challenge.
*  Large paragraphs, too many moving images, too much content as videos (especially help files), no subtitles, pages with too much going on.
* **Best solution would be to create more paragraphs with sub-headings, and utilize bulleted lists when you can.**

### Small font size

![Small font size](/assets/images/smallfontsize.png)
* There's no minimum font size requirement in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, even though it affects so many low-vision users.
* Small font with low contrast to the background image or color can be terribly hard to read for low-vision users.
* Make sure that if a user increases the font size it doesn’t break the site.

### Zooming Problems

![Zooming problems](/assets/images/zooming-problems.png)
* Users with low vision point to layout and navigation problems when zooming or increasing font-size.
* Zooming can break the layout.

### Low contrasts and image of text
* Color contrast is still a major problem in a lot of interfaces.
* Lack of contrast between font color and background color.
* Photo backgrounds that overpower the text on top of them.
* **Vital for web designers and art directors to understand how to measure and create accessible color schemes.**

### Bright color schemes

* Looking at white screens all day can cause eyestrain and headaches.
* The ability to switch to a night mode can help users with eye strain.

### Relying only on color

![Relying only on color](/assets/images/rely-on-color.png)
* Color-coded toggles, heatmaps, etc, can be hard.
* Text links without underline can hard for users to understand they’re links.

### Mouse-focused sites

![Mouse-foucused sites](/assets/images/rely-on-color.png)
* Many sites rely on mouse interaction. Especially for navigation on large screens.
* Sites that insist on using mouse over as the only means of menu triggering is an issue.
* For users with motor impairments that navigate using only their keyboard, a  clear focus outline is vital to being able to navigate the web.

### Too small touch-targets

![Touch targets](/assets/images/touch-targets.png)
* Areas being too small or too big, users accidentally hit them.
* Multi-touch gestures can be challenging for some users as well.

### Captchas

![Captchas](/assets/images/captchas.png)
* Non-accessible captchas can a extremely difficult for users with vision impairment.

### Take aways
- **Web accessibility is about so much more than just blind people with screen readers.**
- **Basically everything that people with disabilities comment on are things that annoy everyone, so fixing these issues makes your interface better for all users!**
- **A lot of what people comment on is not covered by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. So you need to test with users with disabilities!**
