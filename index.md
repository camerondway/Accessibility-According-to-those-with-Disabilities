### Take aways
- Web accessibility is about so much more than just blind people with screen readers.
- Basically everything that people with disabilities comment on are things that annoy everyone, so fixing these issues makes your interface better for all users!
- A lot of what people comment on is not covered by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. So you need to test with users with disabilities!
