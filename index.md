## Accessibility According to those with Disabilities

[This](https://axesslab.com/accessibility-according-to-pwd/) all started with a tweet asking those on the internet who have disabilities what can be a struggle on the web.

### Lack of captions

* Videos without captions(subtitles) was said the most.
  * Videos without captions can exclude users who are deaf or hard of hearing and could also affect users who forgot headphones on the train, or a place where sound can’t be played aloud. Sometimes even autistic people rely on captions if their senses become overloaded. It can be confusing if a person is talking off screen for them.
  * Do not rely on Youtube's auto subtitling, it isn’t completely accurate yet.

### Take aways
- Web accessibility is about so much more than just blind people with screen readers.
- Basically everything that people with disabilities comment on are things that annoy everyone, so fixing these issues makes your interface better for all users!
- A lot of what people comment on is not covered by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. So you need to test with users with disabilities!
